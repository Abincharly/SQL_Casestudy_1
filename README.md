## Introduction

Welcome to the Danny's Diner Case Study! In the beginning of 2021, Danny embarked on a risky venture by opening up a cute little restaurant that specializes in his three favorite Japanese foods: sushi, curry, and ramen.

Dannyâ€™s Diner is in need of assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat. While the restaurant has captured some basic data from its few months of operation, they have no idea how to use this data to effectively run the business.

## Problem Statement

Danny aims to utilize the data to answer several simple questions about his customers, particularly regarding their visiting patterns, spending habits, and favorite menu items. Establishing a deeper connection with his customers will enable him to provide a better and more personalized experience for his loyal patrons.

For this case study, Danny has provided three key datasets:

* **Sales**: Information about customer transactions, including timestamps, customer IDs, and menu items purchased.
* **Menu**: A list of available menu items, each associated with a unique identifier and its respective category.
* **Members**: Data about members who have joined a loyalty program.

## Case Study Questions

The following questions will guide our analysis:

1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. What is the total number of items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier, how many points would each customer have?
10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date), they earn 2x points on all items. How many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
